            <h2>NFT</h2>
                <p>It's hard to know where to begin with the big wide world of NFTs. Should I care? Can I wear a blockchain? Why is Beeple such a certified freak? Nathan does his best to answer some of these questions in the video below.
                    NFTs are certainly gaining ground in the art world — but they’re more than just a fad for the rich and tiring. They are tools every digital artist can use to sign their work and ensure it’s never plagiarised — whether or not you’re just starting out, determined to remain indie, or have “made it” to the mainstream and are getting pats on the back for work like a blank piece of paper you’ve stared at (yes, that really happened).
                    Here’s an easy way to understand what NFTs are, how they work and why they are so darn useful.
                </br>
                <h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
                <div class="text1"><p>Simply put, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a way to prove digital ownership. Here are the top 3 things we think you should know about them, so you can use them safely and easily as an artist or art collector.
                   </p></div>
                 
                <table>
                    <td>
                        <tr>
                            <img src="../IMG/maxresdefaul.jpg" class="img1">
                        </tr>
                    </td>
                </table>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        They are built on blockchains. These are distributed public ledgers that record transactions. Each NFT is stored on the blockchain with an identification code and metadata that makes it as unique as a fingerprint. In this context, “metadata” means “data about data” and is simply a bit of extra information that describes the NFT and is stored alongside it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They’re an excellent way to mark digital assets and control their supply. Whether you’ve created a piece of music, a digital artwork or video, “minting” it as an NFT means that you can prove ownership over it (as each NFT is distinct and traceable). Previously, digital assets were fairly easy to steal. This is huge as it means artists can’t be cheated out of royalties anymore and collectors don’t have to worry about investing in something that’s a fake or a forgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Think of them as digital receipts or signatures. If you’re a collector, NFTs can be considered the digital equivalent of the kind of receipt you’d get after you’ve bought something physical (like clothing or food) from your favourite store. As an artist, turning your work into an NFT is a way of adding a digital signature that can never be forged or removed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        <p>
            So whether you’re able to purchase limited first edition prints for large sums or starting up your collection with a piece that costs $1, working with NFTs makes sure that everybody wins. The artist is credited for their work (and are paid royalties in perpetuity), you’re credited as the rightful owner, and nobody is being priced out of the market by (or losing money to) elitist intermediaries.
